> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This project is in active development and should be considered alpha software. Features and APIs may change rapidly as we discover new approaches and paradigms.

A sophisticated agent simulation system built on BitECS, featuring autonomous agents with advanced cognitive architectures, capable of dynamic interactions, self-spawning, and emergent narrative generation.

## Overview

ArgOS is an experimental platform for creating and running autonomous agent simulations. It represents a radical departure from traditional AI architectures, implementing a novel cognitive framework that enables genuine agent autonomy and emergence.

### Key Innovations

- **Cognitive Architecture**: A groundbreaking approach to agent consciousness that goes beyond simple prompt-response patterns
- **Emergent Behavior**: Agents develop their own personalities, relationships, and narratives through dynamic interactions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on BitECS for unprecedented performance in large-scale agent simulations
- **Memory Systems**: Advanced hierarchical memory structures that enable genuine learning and adaptation

### Future Trajectory

ArgOS is evolving towards becoming a complete framework for artificial consciousness research and autonomous agent development. Our roadmap includes:

- **Artificial Consciousness**: Developing deeper models of self-awareness and consciousness
- **Emergent Societies**: Enabling large-scale agent interactions that form complex social structures
- **Cross-Reality Integration**: Bridging virtual and physical worlds through agent embodiment
- **Autonomous Evolution**: Allowing agents to modify their own cognitive architectures
- **Narrative Intelligence**: Creating rich, dynamic storylines through agent interactions

### Use Cases

- **Research**: Studying emergence, consciousness, and collective intelligence
- **Gaming & Entertainment**: Creating dynamic, evolving narratives and characters
- **Social Simulation**: Modeling complex human systems and behaviors
- **Training & Education**: Developing adaptive learning environments
- **Creative Applications**: Generating stories, art, and other creative works through agent collaboration

## Current Features

  - Efficient agent state management
  - Component-based architecture
  - Fast query system

- **Agent Systems**

  - Thinking System (cognitive processing)
  - Room System (environment management)
  - Action System (behavior execution)
  - Perception System (stimuli processing)

- **Memory Management**

  - Thought history
  - Experience tracking
  - Context awareness

- **Action Framework**
  - Speech capabilities
  - Environment interaction
  - Tool usage system

## Getting Started

**Requirements**

- Node.js **20.x** is recommended to match the development dependencies.

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the basic conversation example:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start a simulation with two agents in a room, demonstrating basic interaction capabilities.

Some features may require the project to be built before running. Use the following command to compile TypeScript (if applicable):

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Start the full development environment (server and UI):

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Run the test suite:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/project-89/argOS.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd argOS
```

## Configuring the Environment

1. Copy the example environment file and rename it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` and provide values for **all** variables:

```bash
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
DISCORD_MONITOR_CHANNEL_ID=channel-id-to-monitor
DISCORD_ANNOUNCEMENT_CHANNEL_ID=channel-id-for-announcements
DEBUG=true
```

## Architecture

The system is built on several core components:

1. **World State**

   - Resource management
   - Narrative state tracking
   - Population management

2. **Agent Components**

   - Core agent properties
   - Memory systems
   - Action capabilities
   - Relationship tracking

3. **Systems**
   - Cognitive processing
   - Environmental interaction
   - Action execution
   - State management

For a detailed architectural overview, see `DESIGN_DOC.md`.

## Development Status

Currently implemented:

- [x] Basic agent interactions and conversations
- [x] Simple Thought generation with LLM integration
- [x] Basic Environment awareness and room system
- [x] Basic action and perception system
- [x] Simple Memory tracking (thoughts and experiences)
- [x] Speech and examination tools

In progress:

- [ ] Physical actions and body awareness
- [ ] Enhanced agent perception (sight, sound, smell)
- [ ] Long term vector memory
- [ ] Goal setting and planning system
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination
- [ ] Core memory systems (childhood, significant experiences)
- [ ] Relationship formation and tracking

Planned features:

- [ ] Self-spawning capabilities (agent reproduction)
- [ ] Dynamic narrative generation
- [ ] World generation from text prompts
- [ ] World state as entity relationships
- [ ] Meta-agent for narrative control
- [ ] Tool system for world modification
- [ ] Long-term persistence and database integration
- [ ] Advanced memory hierarchies
  - Working memory
  - Episodic memory
  - Semantic memory
  - Procedural memory

## Running Examples

The project includes several example scenarios:

- `basic-conversation.ts`: Two agents engaging in basic interaction

## Discord Monitoring Flow

ArgOS can connect to a Discord channel and generate automated summaries.
To enable this feature, configure a Discord bot and provide `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`,
`DISCORD_MONITOR_CHANNEL_ID` and `DISCORD_ANNOUNCEMENT_CHANNEL_ID` in your `.env`
file. See `docs/DISCORD_REPORT_FLOW.md` for a step-by-step outline.
