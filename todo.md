# TinySim Progressive Development Plan

## Core Principles

- Each step should be independently testable
- Run and verify after each major change
- Keep complexity manageable
- Build features progressively
- Document assumptions and decisions

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current Focus)

- [ ] Fix current type errors and missing implementations

  - [ ] Add missing type definitions
  - [ ] Implement missing functions
  - [ ] Fix component references

- [ ] Clean up system registration

  - [ ] Create proper system registry
  - [ ] Add system dependencies
  - [ ] Make registration type-safe

- [ ] Basic agent-to-agent conversation
  - [ ] Simplify to just message passing first
  - [ ] Add basic response generation
  - [ ] Test with two agents

Testing Checkpoint 1:

- Should see basic back-and-forth conversation
- Each step logged clearly
- No complex cognitive processes yet

## Phase 2: Basic Cognitive Loop

- [ ] Continuous Processing

  - [ ] Implement processing flags in components
  - [ ] Add basic thought generation
  - [ ] Test autonomous operation

- [ ] Simple Memory System
  - [ ] Add short-term memory storage
  - [ ] Implement basic memory retrieval
  - [ ] Test memory influence on responses

Testing Checkpoint 2:

- Agents should generate autonomous thoughts
- Should remember recent interactions
- Should refer to past context in responses

## Phase 3: Emotional and Goal Systems

- [ ] Basic Emotional Processing

  - [ ] Implement emotional state tracking
  - [ ] Add emotional responses
  - [ ] Test emotional influence

- [ ] Simple Goal System
  - [ ] Add basic goal tracking
  - [ ] Implement goal influence on decisions
  - [ ] Test goal-directed behavior

Testing Checkpoint 3:

- Emotions should affect responses
- Goals should influence decisions
- Should see personality consistency

## Phase 4: Tool Usage Foundation

- [ ] Basic Tool System

  - [ ] Implement tool registry
  - [ ] Add tool discovery
  - [ ] Test basic tool usage

- [ ] Tool Integration
  - [ ] Add tool-specific components
  - [ ] Implement tool memory
  - [ ] Test tool effectiveness

Testing Checkpoint 4:

- Agents should discover available tools
- Should use tools appropriately
- Should remember tool experiences

## Implementation Notes

Current Issues to Address:

1. AgentConfig needs personality type
2. Conversation factory needs rich context type
3. Missing ActionDecisionState implementation
4. Need to implement missing system functions

Next Immediate Steps:

1. Fix type errors
2. Implement missing functions
3. Add basic test suite
4. Verify basic conversation flow

Design Decisions:

- Keep components small and focused
- Use flags for system processing
- Maintain clear system dependencies
- Log everything for debugging

Future Considerations:

- How to handle parallel processing
- Memory optimization strategies
- System scheduling approaches
- State persistence needs

## Testing Strategy

- Create test scenarios for each phase
- Verify each component independently
- Test system interactions
- Validate behavioral consistency
