# Memory Consolidation and Integration

## Memory Consolidation Process

Memory consolidation in ArgOS mirrors how human brains process and store information. Just as humans consolidate short-term memories into long-term storage during rest periods, our agents undergo sophisticated memory processing that strengthens important memories while allowing less significant ones to fade.

### ConsolidationSystem

The consolidation process is handled by a specialized system:

    export const MemoryConsolidationSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const entities = query(world, [
            EpisodicMemory,
            SemanticMemory,
            ConsolidationState
        ])

        for (const eid of entities) {
            // Get memories awaiting consolidation
            const pendingMemories = getPendingMemories(world, eid)

            for (const memory of pendingMemories) {
                // Evaluate memory significance
                const significance = evaluateMemorySignificance(world, eid, memory)

                // Extract patterns and general knowledge
                const patterns = extractPatterns(world, eid, memory)

                // Update semantic knowledge
                if (patterns.length > 0) {
                    updateSemanticKnowledge(world, eid, patterns)
                }

                // Strengthen or weaken memory based on significance
                adjustMemoryStrength(world, eid, memory, significance)

                // Create or update memory associations
                updateMemoryAssociations(world, eid, memory)
            }

            // Clean up consolidated memories
            cleanupProcessedMemories(world, eid)
        }

        return world
    })

### Memory Forgetting

Just as important as remembering is the ability to forget. Our forgetting system models natural memory decay:

    export const MemoryDecaySystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const entities = query(world, [EpisodicMemory, MemoryDecayRules])

        for (const eid of entities) {
            // Get all memories
            const memories = getAllMemories(world, eid)

            for (const memory of memories) {
                // Calculate decay based on time and usage
                const decayFactor = calculateDecayFactor(world, eid, memory)

                // Apply decay
                applyMemoryDecay(world, eid, memory, decayFactor)

                // Remove completely faded memories
                if (memory.strength < MEMORY_THRESHOLD) {
                    removeMemory(world, eid, memory)
                }
            }
        }

        return world
    })

## Integration with Other Systems

The memory system doesn't operate in isolation - it's deeply integrated with other cognitive systems:

### Emotional Memory Integration

Emotions play a crucial role in memory formation and recall:

    export const EmotionalMemorySystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const entities = query(world, [
            EpisodicMemory,
            EmotionalState,
            MemoryFormation
        ])

        for (const eid of entities) {
            // Get current emotional state
            const emotionalState = getEmotionalState(world, eid)

            // Process new experiences
            const experiences = getNewExperiences(world, eid)

            for (const exp of experiences) {
                // Tag memory with emotional context
                tagWithEmotionalContext(world, eid, exp, emotionalState)

                // Adjust memory strength based on emotional intensity
                adjustMemoryByEmotion(world, eid, exp, emotionalState)

                // Create emotional associations
                createEmotionalAssociations(world, eid, exp, emotionalState)
            }
        }

        return world
    })

### Decision Support Integration

The memory system provides crucial support for decision-making:

    export const MemoryDecisionSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const entities = query(world, [
            EpisodicMemory,
            SemanticMemory,
            DecisionContext
        ])

        for (const eid of entities) {
            // Get current decision context
            const context = getDecisionContext(world, eid)

            // Find relevant memories
            const relevantMemories = findRelevantMemories(world, eid, context)

            // Extract decision guidance from memories
            const guidance = extractDecisionGuidance(world, eid, relevantMemories)

            // Update decision weights based on past experiences
            updateDecisionWeights(world, eid, guidance)
        }

        return world
    })

### Learning Integration

Memories form the foundation for learning and skill development:

    export const MemoryLearningSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const entities = query(world, [
            EpisodicMemory,
            SemanticMemory,
            LearningState
        ])

        for (const eid of entities) {
            // Get learning-relevant memories
            const memories = getLearningMemories(world, eid)

            // Extract patterns and skills
            const patterns = extractLearningPatterns(world, eid, memories)

            // Update skill levels based on remembered experiences
            updateSkillLevels(world, eid, patterns)

            // Consolidate learned patterns into semantic memory
            consolidateLearning(world, eid, patterns)
        }

        return world
    })

## Advanced Memory Features

### Memory Reconstruction

Memories aren't just recalled - they're reconstructed based on current context:

    export const MemoryReconstructionSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const entities = query(world, [
            EpisodicMemory,
            MemoryReconstruction
        ])

        for (const eid of entities) {
            // Get memory recall requests
            const requests = getRecallRequests(world, eid)

            for (const request of requests) {
                // Find base memory
                const baseMemory = findMemory(world, eid, request)

                // Get current context
                const context = getCurrentContext(world, eid)

                // Reconstruct memory with current context
                const reconstructedMemory = reconstructMemory(
                    world,
                    eid,
                    baseMemory,
                    context
                )

                // Return reconstructed memory
                fulfillRecallRequest(world, eid, request, reconstructedMemory)
            }
        }

        return world
    })
