# Perception System in ArgOS

The Perception System represents how agents sense and understand their environment. Unlike simple radius-based awareness, ArgOS's perception system creates rich, contextual awareness that mirrors how real intelligence processes sensory information.

## Understanding Perception

Real perception isn't just about detecting nearby objects - it's about building a meaningful understanding of the environment. When you walk into a room, you don't just register a list of objects; you understand the context, notice important details, filter irrelevant information, and integrate this understanding with your goals and knowledge.

Our perception system models this sophistication through several key mechanisms:

- Attention-driven focus
- Context-aware filtering
- Multi-sensory integration
- Memory-enhanced perception
- Goal-influenced awareness
- Emotional impact on perception

## Core Perception Components

### SensoryInput Component

This component handles raw sensory data:

    export const SensoryInput = defineComponent({
        // Visual input
        visualField: [] as number[],      // What's visible
        visualAcuity: [] as number[],     // How clearly things are seen
        visualAttention: [] as number[],   // What's being focused on

        // Auditory input
        audioField: [] as number[],       // What's audible
        audioClarity: [] as number[],     // How clearly sounds are heard
        audioFocus: [] as number[],       // What's being listened to

        // Other senses
        proximityData: [] as number[],    // Spatial awareness
        environmentData: [] as number[],  // Environmental conditions
        internalState: [] as number[]     // Body awareness
    })

### PerceptionProcessing Component

This component manages how sensory data is processed:

    export const PerceptionProcessing = defineComponent({
        // Attention management
        attentionFocus: [] as number[],   // Current focus of attention
        attentionStrength: [] as number[], // How intensely focusing
        distractibility: [] as number[],   // Susceptibility to distraction

        // Processing capabilities
        processingSpeed: [] as number[],   // How quickly input is processed
        patternRecognition: [] as number[], // Ability to spot patterns
        contextAwareness: [] as number[],   // Understanding of situation

        // Perception filters
        relevanceFilters: [] as number[],  // What's considered important
        noiseFilters: [] as number[],      // What's filtered out
        priorityWeights: [] as number[]    // How different inputs are weighted
    })

## Perception Systems

### SensoryProcessingSystem

This system handles the initial processing of sensory input:

    export const SensoryProcessingSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const perceivers = query(world, [
            SensoryInput,
            PerceptionProcessing,
            Position
        ])

        for (const pid of perceivers) {
            // Get raw sensory data
            const rawInput = getSensoryInput(world, pid)

            // Apply sensory filters
            const filteredInput = filterSensoryInput(world, pid, rawInput)

            // Process according to attention
            const processedInput = processByAttention(world, pid, filteredInput)

            // Integrate across senses
            const integratedPerception = integrateSensoryData(
                world,
                pid,
                processedInput
            )

            // Update perception state
            updatePerceptionState(world, pid, integratedPerception)
        }

        return world
    })

### AttentionalControlSystem

This sophisticated system manages what agents pay attention to:

    export const AttentionalControlSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const perceivers = query(world, [
            PerceptionProcessing,
            Goals,
            EmotionalState
        ])

        for (const pid of perceivers) {
            // Get current goals
            const goals = getCurrentGoals(world, pid)

            // Get emotional state
            const emotions = getEmotionalState(world, pid)

            // Calculate attention priorities
            const priorities = calculateAttentionPriorities(
                world,
                pid,
                goals,
                emotions
            )

            // Update attention focus
            updateAttentionFocus(world, pid, priorities)

            // Handle distractions
            processDistractions(world, pid)
        }

        return world
    })
