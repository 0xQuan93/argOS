# System Architecture in ArgOS

The system architecture in ArgOS represents the behavioral engine of our simulation. While components store data and entities provide identity, systems are where the magic happens - they're responsible for bringing our simulation to life through carefully orchestrated processing of component data.

## Understanding Systems

In ArgOS, a system isn't just a function that processes data - it's a specialized piece of logic that operates within specific constraints and guarantees. Think of systems like specialized workers in a factory, each with their own specific job but working together in a carefully choreographed dance.

Each system follows what we call the "Pure Processing Principle": it should be possible to run the system multiple times on the same input and get the same output, with no hidden state or side effects. This principle is crucial for debugging, testing, and parallel processing.

## System Categories

Our systems are organized into distinct categories, each serving a specific purpose in the simulation:

### Core Processing Systems

These systems handle the fundamental operations that keep our simulation running. The MovementSystem provides a good example of how a core system operates:

    examples/systems/movement.ts

Notice how the system:

1. Queries only for the components it needs (Position and Velocity)
2. Processes all matching entities in a single pass
3. Makes no assumptions about other systems
4. Maintains high performance through data-oriented design

### Agent Systems

Agent systems handle the sophisticated behaviors that make our agents feel alive. The CognitiveSystem demonstrates this complexity:

    examples/systems/cognitive.ts

This system coordinates multiple subsystems:

- Memory processing
- Emotional updates
- Goal management
- Decision making

Yet it maintains the same pure processing principles as simpler systems.

### Environmental Systems

These systems manage the world our agents inhabit. Consider our PhysicsSystem:

    examples/systems/physics.ts

Environmental systems often need to handle:

- Spatial partitioning for efficient collision detection
- Multi-step physics resolution
- Constraint satisfaction
- State interpolation for smooth visualization

## System Execution Order

One of the most crucial aspects of our architecture is how systems are scheduled and executed. We use a sophisticated scheduling system that:

1. Analyzes component dependencies between systems
2. Automatically determines optimal execution order
3. Identifies opportunities for parallel execution
4. Maintains deterministic simulation results

### The Scheduler

Our scheduler isn't just a simple loop - it's a dynamic orchestrator that can:

- Adapt to changing system loads
- Reorder system execution based on performance metrics
- Split work across multiple threads when possible
- Maintain temporal consistency across the simulation

### Fixed vs Variable Update Systems

Some systems need to run at fixed time intervals for stability (like physics), while others can run at variable rates. Our scheduler handles both:

    examples/systems/scheduler-configuration.ts

## System Communication

While systems are independent, they need to coordinate their actions. We provide several mechanisms for this:

### Event System

Our event system allows systems to communicate without direct coupling:

    examples/systems/event-handling.ts

Events are:

- Typed for compile-time safety
- Queued for deterministic processing
- Efficiently dispatched to interested systems

### Command Pattern

For operations that need to be coordinated across multiple systems, we use commands:

    examples/systems/command-pattern.ts

Commands provide:

- Atomic operations across multiple systems
- Rollback capability for failed operations
- Deterministic execution order
- Transaction-like semantics when needed

## System Development

Creating new systems in ArgOS follows a clear pattern:

### System Template

Every system starts with a basic template that ensures consistency:

    examples/systems/system-template.ts

### Performance Considerations

Systems must be designed with performance in mind:

- Minimize cache misses through data-oriented access patterns
- Avoid allocation during normal operation
- Use appropriate data structures for the task
- Consider parallelization opportunities

### Testing Systems

We provide comprehensive tools for system testing:

    examples/systems/testing.ts

Our testing framework allows:

- Isolated system testing
- Performance profiling
- Deterministic replay of scenarios
- Automated regression testing

## Advanced Topics

For more sophisticated system development:

### Custom System Schedulers

You can create specialized schedulers for specific needs:

    examples/systems/custom-scheduler.ts

### System Groups

Related systems can be grouped for easier management:

    examples/systems/system-groups.ts

### Parallel Systems

Systems that can run in parallel require special consideration:

    examples/systems/parallel-system.ts
