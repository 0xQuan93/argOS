# Tool Interaction and API Usage in TinySim

TinySim agents can interact with real-world tools and APIs through a specialized tool interaction system. This system bridges the gap between the agent's cognitive processes and actual tool functionality.

## Tool Abstraction Layer

When an agent uses a tool like a web browser or document editor, the interaction happens through several layers:

1.  **Tool Interface Layer**
    The agent interacts with an abstract representation of the tool:

        export const WebBrowserTool = defineToolInterface({
            capabilities: {
                browse: {
                    inputs: ["url", "search_query"],
                    outputs: ["webpage_content", "search_results"]
                },
                navigate: {
                    inputs: ["direction", "link_selection"],
                    outputs: ["new_page_state"]
                },
                extract: {
                    inputs: ["selector", "content_type"],
                    outputs: ["extracted_content"]
                }
            }
        })

2.  **Tool Implementation Layer**
    Behind the scenes, this connects to real APIs and services:

        export const WebBrowserImplementation = {
            browse: async (params) => {
                // Connect to real browser automation
                const browser = await puppeteer.launch()
                const page = await browser.newPage()
                await page.goto(params.url)
                // Return results in standardized format
                return processPageContent(page)
            }
        }

## Real-World Tool Integration

Let's look at some specific examples:

### Web Browsing

When an agent needs to browse the web:

1. The agent forms an intention to find information
2. The cognitive system identifies web browsing as appropriate tool
3. The tool system translates this into concrete actions:
   - Formulating search queries
   - Navigating pages
   - Extracting relevant information
4. Results are processed back into the agent's cognitive system

### Document Collaboration

For collaborative document editing:

1. The agent accesses document state through tool interface
2. Changes are proposed based on agent's goals and context
3. The tool system handles:
   - Access control
   - Version management
   - Conflict resolution
   - Real-time updates

### API Interaction

Agents can interact with external APIs through standardized interfaces:

1. The agent expresses need for API-provided functionality
2. Tool system handles:
   - Authentication
   - Request formatting
   - Rate limiting
   - Response processing
3. Results are integrated into agent's knowledge

## Tool Usage Example

Here's how an agent might use a web browser tool:

    export const WebResearchSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const researchers = query(world, [
            ResearchTask,
            ToolUser,
            WebBrowserAccess
        ])

        for (const rid of researchers) {
            // Get research goals
            const task = getResearchTask(world, rid)

            // Formulate search strategy
            const strategy = planSearchStrategy(world, rid, task)

            // Execute web research
            const results = await executeWebSearch(world, rid, strategy)

            // Process and integrate findings
            integrateResearchResults(world, rid, results)
        }
    })

## Tool Coordination

Agents can coordinate tool usage:

1. **Sequential Tool Use**

   - Browser to find information
   - Document editor to record findings
   - Communication tools to share results

2. **Parallel Tool Use**

   - Multiple browser tabs for research
   - Real-time document collaboration
   - Concurrent API interactions

3. **Collaborative Tool Use**
   - Shared document editing
   - Coordinated web research
   - Synchronized tool states

## Safety and Constraints

The tool system includes important safety features:

1. **Access Control**

   - Tool usage permissions
   - Action limitations
   - Resource constraints

2. **Validation**

   - Input sanitization
   - Output verification
   - State consistency checks

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Action frequency limits
   - Resource usage quotas
   - Concurrent access management

## Implementation Details

The tool system maintains several key components:

1. **Tool State**

   - Current tool status
   - Session information
   - Resource usage

2. **Usage History**

   - Action logs
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking

3. **Integration Points**
   - API connections
   - Service bindings
   - Protocol handlers
