# Life Simulation Engine (LSE) MVP Design Document

## Phase 1: World Generation and Querying

### 1. Core ECS System

- [ ] Implement basic ECS architecture
- [ ] Define core components (Position, Name, Description, etc.)
- [ ] Implement entity creation and component attachment

### 2. CLI Interface

- [ ] Set up basic CLI structure
- [ ] Implement commands:
  - [ ] generate-world: Initialize and generate a new world
  - [ ] query-world: Query the current world state
  - [ ] describe-entity: Get detailed information about a specific entity
  - [ ] list-entities: List all entities in the world
  - [ ] add-task: Add a new task for the God AI to process

### 3. God AI

- [ ] Implement task-oriented God AI
  - [ ] Planning system for world generation tasks
  - [ ] Task execution system
- [ ] Integrate with ECS for world manipulation

### 4. World Generation

- [ ] Implement world initialization
- [ ] Create systems for generating:
  - [ ] Locations
  - [ ] Objects
  - [ ] Relationships between entities

### 5. World Querying

- [ ] Implement query system for ECS
- [ ] Create filters for complex queries

### 6. Persistence

- [ ] Implement save/load functionality for world state

### 7. Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for core ECS functions
- [ ] Integration tests for world generation and querying
- [ ] CLI command tests

### 8. Documentation

- [ ] Write user guide for CLI commands
- [ ] Document core ECS and God AI architecture

## Future Considerations (Phase 2)

- Agent implementation with ECS systems for:
  - Planning
  - Memory
  - World querying
  - Task execution

## Task Breakdown for Initial Development

1. Set up project structure
2. Implement basic ECS architecture
3. Create basic components (Position, Name, Description, etc.)
4. Implement entity creation and component attachment
5. Create CLI structure and basic commands
   - generate-world
   - query-world
   - describe-entity
   - list-entities
6. Develop God AI planning system
7. Implement world initialization and basic generation
8. Integrate God AI with ECS for world manipulation
9. Implement world querying system
10. Enhance God AI with task execution
11. Expand world generation capabilities
12. Implement persistence (save/load)
13. Develop testing suite
14. Write documentation

## Next Steps

- Begin with task 1 and proceed through the list
- Regularly review and update this document as development progresses
- Consider creating milestones for major features (e.g., "Basic World Generation", "CLI Functionality", etc.)
