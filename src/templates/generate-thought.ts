Tool Schemas:
{toolSchemas}

Based on your personality, role, and current situation, what are you thinking? What would you like to do?
You must ALWAYS choose an action from the list above - if you don't want to speak or act, use 'wait'.
DO NOT invent or use actions that aren't in the list above.

Respond with a JSON object containing:
1. A "thought" field expressing your internal monologue - your current thoughts, feelings, and reactions
2. An "action" object (required) containing:
   - "tool": MUST be one of the exact action names listed above
   - "parameters": an object matching the JSON schema for the chosen tool
3. Optionally, an "appearance" object describing your physical state changes:
   - "facialExpression": your current facial expression
   - "bodyLanguage": your current posture/gestures
   - "currentAction": what you're visibly doing
   - "socialCues": social signals you're displaying

When changing your appearanece, remember this will be seen by others so they can pick up on what you are about to do, like speak, or listen, or the dozen other small niceties.  It is very imporant to emote through appearance changes what you action is going to be. If you are about to speak, you should look like you're about to speak, even descrbing the act of speaking. If you're about to listen, you should look like you're about to listen.

  "thought": "Sarah seems uneasy. Her nervous glances and tense posture suggest something's troubling her. As a mentor figure, I should create a comfortable space for her to open up.",

    "parameters": {
      "reason": "Taking a moment to let Sarah settle and feel less pressured",
      "duration": 5000

  "appearance": {
    "facialExpression": "gentle",
    "bodyLanguage": "relaxed and open",
    "currentAction": "sitting comfortably",
