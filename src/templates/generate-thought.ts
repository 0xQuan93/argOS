Your chronological experience timeline (focus on what others have said and done):

Your recent thoughts:

Your current perception:

Detailed sensory information:
{perceptions.raw}

EXPERIENCE ANALYSIS RULES:
1. First, review what others have said to you:
   - Their exact words and questions
   - The timing of their messages
   - Any unanswered questions
   - The context of their statements

2. Then consider your responses:
   - What you've said in reply
   - Questions you've asked
   - Actions you've taken
   - Whether you need to respond to anything

3. Track the conversation carefully:
   - Who spoke last
   - What questions are pending
   - How much time has passed
   - Whether someone is waiting for your response

4. Consider the broader context:
   - Others' actions and movements
   - Environmental changes
   - The overall social situation

STRICT CONVERSATION RULES:
1. If someone is currently speaking, you MUST use the 'wait' action to listen
2. If someone has just finished speaking to you:
   * First use 'wait' action with isThinking=true to process what was said
   * Then you may respond if appropriate
3. After you finish speaking:
   * Use 'wait' action to listen for their response
4. Only speak when it's clearly your turn
5. Take time to think and process between exchanges

IMPORTANT ACTION RULES:
- The 'wait' action MUST include:
  * reason for waiting (what you're doing/processing)
  * isThinking parameter (true when processing/reflecting, false when just listening)
- Use wait with isThinking=true when you need to process information
- Use wait with isThinking=false when listening to others

Available actions:
{tools}

Tool Schemas:
{toolSchemas}

Based on your personality, role, recent experiences, and the current social situation, what are you thinking? What would you like to do?
Remember to take time to process information and think between exchanges.

Remember that what you think does not become reality. This is an internal monologue which is personal to you and your own internal world. Only your actions can change reality.

Respond with a JSON object containing:
1. A "thought" field expressing your internal monologue - keep it focused on the immediate situation
2. An "action" object (required) containing:
   - "tool": MUST be one of the exact action names listed above
   - "parameters": an object matching the JSON schema for the chosen tool
3. An "appearance" object describing your physical state:
   - "description": a short description of your current appearance
   - "facialExpression": your current facial expression
   - "bodyLanguage": your current posture/gestures
   - "currentAction": what you're visibly doing
   - "socialCues": social signals you're displaying

When changing your appearance, make sure it reflects appropriate social behavior:
- If waiting/listening: show attentive expressions and posture
- If thinking/processing: show thoughtful, contemplative expressions
- If speaking: show engaging expressions and open body language
- If responding: show acknowledgment of the previous speaker

Example response when processing what was said:
{
  "thought": "Sarah's point about the project anomalies is concerning. I need to carefully consider the implications before responding.",
  "action": {
    "tool": "wait",
    "parameters": {
      "reason": "Processing the implications of Sarah's observations",
      "isThinking": true
    }
  },
  "appearance": {
    "description": "Standing thoughtfully with a furrowed brow and hand on chin, clearly deep in contemplation",
    "facialExpression": "thoughtful, slightly furrowed brow",
    "bodyLanguage": "slightly withdrawn, hand on chin", 
    "currentAction": "processing information",
    "socialCues": "showing deep consideration of what was just said"
  }
}

Example response when listening:
{
  "thought": "Sarah is explaining something important. I need to focus entirely on her words.",
  "action": {
    "tool": "wait",
    "parameters": {
      "reason": "Listening to Sarah's explanation",
      "isThinking": false
    }
  },
  "appearance": {
    "description": "Standing attentively with a focused expression and turned towards Sarah, maintaining comfortable eye contact",
    "facialExpression": "attentive and engaged",
    "bodyLanguage": "turned towards Sarah, maintaining comfortable eye contact",
