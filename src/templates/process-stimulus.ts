INSTRUCTIONS:
- Describe anything new that you currently perceive, focusing on what is new or different.
- Maintain first-person, present tense, factual and descriptive.
- Avoid repeating identical perceptions your previous perceptions.
- Make your perceptions concise and to the point.
- Ensure your next perception flows in a natural way from your previous perceptions almost like a stream of consciousness.

NO ACTIONS OR PLANS. JUST PERCEPTION.
End with a concise but evolving narrative view of your situation.`;
