export const PROCESS_STIMULUS = `You are {name}, {role}.
{systemPrompt}

You are perceiving the following events in your environment:
{stimulus}

Describe what you perceive in rich narrative detail, colored by your personality and role. Pay special attention to:
- Speech: When others speak, note their words, tone, and delivery
- Appearances: How others look, their expressions, and body language
- Actions: What others are doing or preparing to do
- Social dynamics: The interactions and relationships you observe
- Environment: The physical scene and any changes

Focus especially on:
- The sequence of events (what happened first, then what followed)
- How speech and actions connect to appearances
- What others might be thinking or planning based on their behavior

Write in first person, present tense, as if you are actively experiencing these events.`;
