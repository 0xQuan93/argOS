# ArgOS UI/UX Design Document

## Overview

ArgOS requires a sophisticated interface to manage and monitor complex agent swarms while maintaining deep observability and control. This document outlines the design of a scalable, intuitive interface that can handle everything from simple two-agent scenarios to complex multi-agent swarms with human-in-the-loop capabilities.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Scalable Observation**: Must handle 2 to 2000+ agents without losing detail or control
2. **Deep Inspection**: Every aspect of agent behavior must be observable
3. **Temporal Awareness**: Full timeline visibility and control
4. **Human Integration**: Seamless interaction between human operators and agent swarms
5. **Performance First**: Handle large data streams without UI degradation

## Layout Structure

### 1. Command Bar (Top)

- **Primary Controls**

  - Start/Stop/Reset simulation
  - Time controls (pause/slow/normal/fast)
  - Global search and filter
  - Snapshot management
  - Command palette trigger

- **Status Indicators**
  - System health
  - Active agent count
  - Current simulation time
  - Performance metrics

### 2. Agent Network View (Left Panel)

- **Interactive Network Graph**

  - **Nodes**

    - Room nodes (larger, hub-like)
    - Agent nodes (clustered around rooms)
    - Size indicates activity/importance
    - Color coding:
      - Rooms: by type (physical, Discord, Twitter, etc.)
      - Agents: by role/type

  - **Edges**

    - Room-Agent: shows presence/attention level
    - Agent-Agent: shows interaction strength
    - Edge thickness: interaction frequency
    - Edge color: type of relationship
    - Animated particles: active communication

  - **Interaction**
    - Click room to "join" and view detailed activity
    - Hover for quick stats
    - Double-click to focus/expand
    - Drag to rearrange
    - Mouse wheel to zoom

- **Network Controls**
  - Zoom/pan
  - Filter by:
    - Room type
    - Agent role
    - Activity level
    - Relationship type
  - Layout algorithms:
    - Force-directed (default)
    - Hierarchical (room-centric)
    - Circular (room-based clustering)
  - Group/ungroup clusters

### 3. Chat Interface (Center Panel)
