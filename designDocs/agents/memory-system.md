# Memory System in TinySim

The memory system in TinySim goes beyond simple data storage to model how intelligent agents actually form, maintain, and use memories. This sophisticated approach enables agents to learn from experiences, develop preferences, and make informed decisions based on past events.

## Understanding Memory in TinySim

Human memory isn't like computer storage - it's dynamic, associative, and often imperfect. Our memory system mirrors these characteristics to create more realistic agent behavior. When an agent experiences something, the memory isn't stored as raw data - it's processed, contextualized, and integrated with existing knowledge.

Consider how a human remembers a social interaction. They don't just record what was said - they remember:

- How they felt during the conversation
- The context and environment
- Related past experiences
- Their impression of the other person
- What they learned or achieved
- Any decisions or commitments made

Our memory system captures these nuances through several specialized components and systems.

## Memory Components

### EpisodicMemory Component

This component stores specific experiences and events:

    export const EpisodicMemory = defineComponent({
        // Core memory data
        timestamp: [] as number[],        // When the memory was formed
        emotionalState: [] as number[],   // Emotional context of memory
        importance: [] as number[],       // Memory significance
        clarity: [] as number[],          // How clear/reliable the memory is

        // Memory content
        context: [] as number[],          // Situational context
        participants: [] as number[],     // Who was involved
        outcomes: [] as number[],         // What resulted
        learnings: [] as number[],        // What was learned

        // Memory metadata
        lastRecall: [] as number[],       // When last remembered
        recallCount: [] as number[],      // How often remembered
        associativeLinks: [] as number[]  // Connected memories
    })

### SemanticMemory Component

This component represents general knowledge and understanding:

    export const SemanticMemory = defineComponent({
        // Knowledge categories
        factualKnowledge: [] as number[],    // Known facts
        procedualKnowledge: [] as number[],  // Known procedures
        conceptualKnowledge: [] as number[], // Abstract concepts

        // Knowledge metadata
        confidence: [] as number[],          // Certainty in knowledge
        sourceType: [] as number[],          // How knowledge was acquired
        lastValidation: [] as number[],      // When last confirmed

        // Knowledge relationships
        prerequisites: [] as number[],       // Required prior knowledge
        implications: [] as number[]         // Derived knowledge
    })

## Memory Processing Systems

### MemoryFormationSystem

This system handles how new experiences become memories:

    export const MemoryFormationSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const entities = query(world, [
            EpisodicMemory,
            SemanticMemory,
            ExperienceBuffer
        ])

        for (const eid of entities) {
            // Process recent experiences
            const experiences = getRecentExperiences(world, eid)

            for (const exp of experiences) {
                // Evaluate significance
                const importance = evaluateImportance(world, eid, exp)

                // Form episodic memory if significant
                if (importance > MEMORY_THRESHOLD) {
                    createEpisodicMemory(world, eid, exp, importance)
                }

                // Extract semantic knowledge
                const knowledge = extractKnowledge(world, eid, exp)
                if (knowledge) {
                    updateSemanticMemory(world, eid, knowledge)
                }

                // Create associative links
                createMemoryAssociations(world, eid, exp)
            }

            // Consolidate new memories
            consolidateMemories(world, eid)
        }

        return world
    })

### MemoryRetrievalSystem

This system manages how memories are accessed and used:

    export const MemoryRetrievalSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const entities = query(world, [
            EpisodicMemory,
            SemanticMemory,
            MemoryQuery
        ])

        for (const eid of entities) {
            // Get memory queries
            const queries = getMemoryQueries(world, eid)

            for (const query of queries) {
                // Search episodic memories
                const episodes = findRelevantEpisodes(world, eid, query)

                // Search semantic knowledge
                const knowledge = findRelevantKnowledge(world, eid, query)

                // Combine and contextualize results
                const memories = integrateMemories(episodes, knowledge)

                // Update memory strengths
                reinforceMemories(world, eid, memories)

                // Return results
                resolveMemoryQuery(world, eid, query, memories)
            }
        }

        return world
    })
