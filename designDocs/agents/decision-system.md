# Decision Making System in TinySim

The Decision Making System represents the cognitive heart of our agents - it's where all our sophisticated subsystems come together to produce meaningful, contextual behavior. Unlike simple decision trees or state machines, TinySim's decision making system creates rich, nuanced choices that emerge from the interplay of emotions, memories, goals, and current context.

## Understanding Decision Making

Real intelligence isn't just about selecting the "best" option from a predefined list. It's about understanding context, weighing multiple factors, considering past experiences, and balancing competing goals. Our decision system mirrors this complexity by treating decisions as emergent processes rather than simple selections.

When an agent needs to make a decision, they engage in a sophisticated process that mirrors human cognitive patterns. Consider how a human decides what to do next at work - they don't just pick from a list of tasks. They consider their energy level, emotional state, relationships with coworkers, past experiences with similar tasks, current priorities, and available resources. Our decision system creates this same rich context for agent decisions.

## Core Decision Components

The decision system builds on several specialized components that work together to create sophisticated decision-making capabilities:

### DecisionContext Component

This component captures everything relevant to the current decision:

    export const DecisionContext = defineComponent({
        // Current situation assessment
        urgency: [] as number[],         // How time-critical is the decision
        importance: [] as number[],       // How significant is the outcome
        complexity: [] as number[],       // How many factors to consider

        // Decision constraints
        timeAvailable: [] as number[],    // Time available for decision
        resourcesAvailable: [] as number[], // Available resources

        // Outcome preferences
        riskTolerance: [] as number[],    // Current risk acceptance
        priorityWeights: [] as number[]   // How to weight different factors
    })

### DecisionCapability Component

This defines an agent's decision-making abilities:

    export const DecisionCapability = defineComponent({
        // Cognitive capabilities
        analysisDepth: [] as number[],    // How deeply to analyze options
        patternRecognition: [] as number[], // Ability to see patterns

        // Decision style
        impulsiveness: [] as number[],    // Tendency to quick decisions
        deliberation: [] as number[],     // Tendency to careful analysis

        // Learning capability
        adaptability: [] as number[],     // Ability to learn from outcomes
        experienceLeverage: [] as number[] // How well past experience is used
    })

### DecisionMemory Component

This component stores information about past decisions and their outcomes:

    export const DecisionMemory = defineComponent({
        // Past decisions
        recentDecisions: [] as number[],  // Recent decision history
        outcomeHistory: [] as number[],   // Results of past decisions

        // Learning data
        successPatterns: [] as number[],  // What has worked before
        failurePatterns: [] as number[],  // What hasn't worked

        // Context patterns
        situationalLearning: [] as number[] // Context-specific knowledge
    })

## The Decision Making Process

The decision process involves several interconnected systems that work together to produce sophisticated decision-making behavior:

### SituationAssessmentSystem

This system evaluates the current context for decision making:

    export const SituationAssessmentSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const decisionMakers = query(world, [
            DecisionContext,
            Perception,
            EmotionalState
        ])

        for (const eid of decisionMakers) {
            // Gather environmental information
            const environment = assessEnvironment(world, eid)

            // Consider emotional influence
            const emotionalContext = getEmotionalInfluence(world, eid)

            // Evaluate social context
            const socialContext = assessSocialSituation(world, eid)

            // Integrate all factors
            updateDecisionContext(world, eid, {
                environment,
                emotionalContext,
                socialContext
            })
        }

        return world
    })

### OptionGenerationSystem

This system creates possible courses of action:

    export const OptionGenerationSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const decisionMakers = query(world, [
            DecisionContext,
            DecisionCapability,
            DecisionMemory
        ])

        for (const eid of decisionMakers) {
            // Generate options based on current context
            const context = getDecisionContext(world, eid)

            // Consider past experiences
            const relevantExperiences = findRelevantExperiences(world, eid, context)

            // Generate standard options
            const standardOptions = generateStandardOptions(world, eid, context)

            // Generate creative options
            const creativeOptions = generateCreativeOptions(world, eid, context)

            // Combine and filter options
            const validOptions = filterValidOptions(world, eid, [
                ...standardOptions,
                ...creativeOptions
            ])

            // Store options for evaluation
            storeDecisionOptions(world, eid, validOptions)
        }

        return world
    })

### OptionEvaluationSystem

This system assesses the potential outcomes of different options:

    export const OptionEvaluationSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const decisionMakers = query(world, [
            DecisionContext,
            DecisionOptions,
            EmotionalState
        ])

        for (const eid of decisionMakers) {
            const options = getDecisionOptions(world, eid)

            for (const option of options) {
                // Predict outcomes
                const outcomes = predictOutcomes(world, eid, option)

                // Evaluate risks
                const risks = assessRisks(world, eid, option, outcomes)

                // Consider emotional impact
                const emotionalImpact = evaluateEmotionalImpact(world, eid, option)

                // Calculate overall value
                const value = calculateOptionValue(world, eid, {
                    outcomes,
                    risks,
                    emotionalImpact
                })

                // Store evaluation results
                storeOptionEvaluation(world, eid, option, value)
            }
        }

        return world
    })

### DecisionSelectionSystem

This system makes the final decision based on all available information:

    export const DecisionSelectionSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const decisionMakers = query(world, [
            DecisionContext,
            DecisionOptions,
            EmotionalState,
            Goals
        ])

        for (const eid of decisionMakers) {
            // Get evaluated options
            const options = getEvaluatedOptions(world, eid)

            // Consider current goals
            const goals = getCurrentGoals(world, eid)

            // Apply emotional influence
            const emotionalState = getEmotionalState(world, eid)

            // Make final selection
            const decision = selectBestOption(world, eid, {
                options,
                goals,
                emotionalState
            })

            // Record decision
            recordDecision(world, eid, decision)

            // Initiate action
            initiateAction(world, eid, decision)
        }

        return world
    })

## Decision Learning and Adaptation

The decision system includes sophisticated learning mechanisms:

### DecisionLearningSystem

This system helps agents learn from their decisions:

    export const DecisionLearningSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const decisionMakers = query(world, [
            DecisionMemory,
            DecisionCapability
        ])

        for (const eid of decisionMakers) {
            // Analyze recent decisions
            const recentDecisions = getRecentDecisions(world, eid)

            for (const decision of recentDecisions) {
                // Evaluate outcomes
                const outcome = evaluateDecisionOutcome(world, eid, decision)

                // Update success/failure patterns
                updateDecisionPatterns(world, eid, decision, outcome)

                // Adjust decision strategies
                refineDecisionStrategies(world, eid, decision, outcome)

                // Update situational learning
                updateContextualKnowledge(world, eid, decision, outcome)
            }

            // Consolidate learning
            consolidateDecisionLearning(world, eid)
        }

        return world
    })
