# Social System in TinySim

The Social System represents how agents interact, form groups, and influence each other's behavior. Unlike simple interaction systems that just pass messages between agents, TinySim's social system creates rich, emergent social behaviors through the complex interplay of relationships, emotions, status, and group dynamics.

## Understanding Social Interaction

Real social interaction isn't just about exchanging information - it's about building relationships, understanding social context, managing status hierarchies, and navigating group dynamics. Our social system models these complexities to create believable social behaviors.

When agents interact, they consider:

- Their relationship history with other agents
- Current emotional states of all participants
- Social status and hierarchies
- Group affiliations and loyalties
- Cultural norms and expectations
- Personal goals and motivations
- Environmental context

## Core Social Components

### SocialContext Component

This component tracks an agent's current social situation:

    export const SocialContext = defineComponent({
        // Current social environment
        presentAgents: [] as number[],     // Who is present
        activeInteractions: [] as number[], // Ongoing interactions
        socialGroups: [] as number[],      // Active group contexts

        // Social status
        statusLevel: [] as number[],       // Current social standing
        influence: [] as number[],         // Ability to affect others
        reputation: [] as number[],        // How others view the agent

        // Social awareness
        attentionFocus: [] as number[],    // Who they're focused on
        socialCues: [] as number[],        // Perceived social signals
        groupAwareness: [] as number[]     // Understanding of group dynamics
    })

### SocialCapability Component

This defines an agent's social abilities:

    export const SocialCapability = defineComponent({
        // Social skills
        empathy: [] as number[],           // Ability to understand others
        expressiveness: [] as number[],    // Ability to communicate
        persuasion: [] as number[],        // Ability to influence others

        // Social learning
        adaptability: [] as number[],      // Ability to adjust behavior
        observation: [] as number[],       // Ability to read situations
        memory: [] as number[],           // Recall of social experiences

        // Group dynamics
        leadership: [] as number[],        // Ability to lead groups
        cooperation: [] as number[],       // Ability to work with others
        conformity: [] as number[]         // Tendency to follow group norms
    })

## Social Processing Systems

### SocialInteractionSystem

This system manages direct interactions between agents:

    export const SocialInteractionSystem = defineSystem((world) => {
        const socialAgents = query(world, [
            SocialContext,
            SocialCapability,
            EmotionalState
        ])

        for (const aid of socialAgents) {
            // Get current social context
            const context = getSocialContext(world, aid)

            // Process ongoing interactions
            for (const interaction of context.activeInteractions) {
                // Update interaction state
                updateInteractionState(world, aid, interaction)

                // Generate social responses
                const response = generateSocialResponse(world, aid, interaction)

                // Apply social influence
                applySocialInfluence(world, aid, interaction, response)

                // Update relationships
                updateRelationships(world, aid, interaction)
            }

            // Initiate new interactions if appropriate
            initiateNewInteractions(world, aid, context)
        }

        return world
    })
