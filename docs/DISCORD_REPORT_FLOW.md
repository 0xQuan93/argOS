# Discord Monitoring and Reporting Flow

This document outlines how ArgOS agents can monitor a Discord channel, summarize the discussion, and push the summary to a separate Git repository.

## Overview

1. **Discord Integration**
   - Use a Discord bot to listen to messages in the target channel.
   - Convert each new message into a stimulus that can be processed by the agent system.

2. **Agent Processing**
   - Agents treat the Discord channel as a `Room` of type `"discord"`.
   - Received stimuli are fed through the usual perception and cognition systems.
   - A dedicated reporting agent compiles key points from the channel activity.

3. **Summary Generation**
   - Periodically (e.g., once per day) the reporting agent produces a concise summary.
   - The summary is written to a markdown file.

4. **Commit to External Repository**
   - Use a Git client library or CLI to commit the summary file to a separate repository.
   - Push the commit with a message indicating the date and channel.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create a Discord Bot**
   - Register a new bot on the Discord developer portal.
   - Invite the bot to the channel with permission to read messages.
   - Store the bot token in `.env` and load it in your integration code.

2. **Add a Discord Integration Service**
   - Build a small Node service that listens for Discord events and injects stimuli into the ArgOS `Room` representing the channel.
   - Each message should include the author and timestamp so agents can track context.

3. **Design the Reporting Agent**
   - Implement an agent with access to the Discord room's stimuli history.
   - After a configurable time span, compile important messages or topics.
   - Use the system's language model integration to produce a short summary.

4. **Write the Summary to a Git Repo**
   - Create or clone the target repository locally.
   - When the summary is generated, write it to a new markdown file (e.g., `reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
   - Commit and push the file using Node's `child_process` to invoke `git` or a Git library.

5. **Scheduling**
   - Use `cron` or a job scheduler to trigger summary generation and git commits at regular intervals.

## Example Folder Structure

```
|-- integrations/
|   `-- discordBot.ts       # Handles Discord events and message forwarding
|-- agents/
|   `-- reportingAgent.ts   # Aggregates stimuli and creates summaries
|-- scripts/
|   `-- pushSummary.ts      # Commits and pushes the summary
```

## Security Considerations

- Keep Discord tokens and Git credentials secure in environment variables.
- Consider rate limits and message volume when processing Discord events.
- Ensure the reporting agent respects privacy expectations for the channel.

## Next Steps

- Prototype the Discord bot and confirm messages can be received.
- Connect the bot's messages to the ArgOS stimulus system.
- Implement the reporting agent logic and automate the Git commit pipeline.
