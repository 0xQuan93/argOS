Your current cognitive architecture is robust and thoughtful, with clear intent to create a lifelike simulation of cognition and behavior. Below, I’ll provide a comprehensive critique of your systems, cognitive architecture, agent prompting, and structuring. I'll also suggest new systems and refinements to further enhance your approach.

Critique of Existing Systems

1. RoomSystem
   Strengths: Efficiently updates room states and generates environmental stimuli.
   Potential Improvements:
   Ambient Dynamics: Introduce room-level behaviors or changes over time (e.g., shifting light, dynamic ambient sound) to add environmental richness.
   Social Dynamics: Track room-level social dynamics (e.g., tension, collaboration) based on the behaviors of occupants.
2. PerceptionSystem
   Strengths: The structured prioritization of stimuli is excellent, ensuring the agent focuses on what is relevant.
   Potential Improvements:
   Saliency Refinement: Incorporate multi-modal saliency scoring. For example, cross-referencing auditory and visual stimuli could prioritize events where both modalities overlap.
   Subtlety Handling: Add a way to capture subtle, background stimuli that may not demand immediate action but could influence long-term memory or mood.
3. ThinkingSystem
   Strengths: Clear separation of thought generation and action decisions aligns well with cognitive models.
   Potential Improvements:
   Interruptive Thought Cycles: Introduce a way for high-priority stimuli to interrupt ongoing thought processes, emulating surprise or shock.
   Internal Conflicts: Add conflicting internal drives or goals to generate more nuanced and human-like decisions.
4. ActionSystem
   Strengths: Executes actions effectively, with integration into memory.
   Potential Improvements:
   Action Sequencing: Allow for more complex, multi-step action sequences rather than single atomic actions.
   Feedback Loop: Introduce feedback to adjust planned actions based on their perceived success.
5. ExperienceSystem
   Strengths: Extracts meaningful, reflective experiences effectively.
   Potential Improvements:
   Social Context Analysis: Extract experiences not just from stimuli but from multi-agent interactions (e.g., disagreements, agreements).
   Emotional Weighting: Incorporate emotional salience to prioritize experiences with high personal relevance.
6. GoalPlanningSystem
   Strengths: Evaluates and adjusts goals based on context and experiences.
   Potential Improvements:
   Meta-Goals: Introduce overarching meta-goals that can influence or veto specific goals (e.g., self-preservation, long-term learning).
   Negotiation: For multi-agent systems, allow negotiation and goal alignment between agents.
7. PlanningSystem
   Strengths: Breaks goals into actionable steps.
   Potential Improvements:
   Dynamic Plan Adjustment: Allow plans to dynamically adjust based on environmental changes or unexpected outcomes.
8. CleanupSystem
   Strengths: Removes expired entities and stimuli effectively.
   Potential Improvements:
   Resource Reallocation: Recycle expired entities or stimuli into new constructs, emulating "forgetting" or reinterpretation.
   Cognitive Architecture Critique
   Strengths
   Separation of Systems: Clear delineation between conscious, subconscious, and reflective systems is highly commendable.
   Bottom-Up and Top-Down Integration: Stimuli flow upwards from the environment, and goals flow downwards to influence perception and action—a well-designed structure.
   Weaknesses
   Lack of Emotional Dynamics: The current architecture doesn’t seem to fully account for emotional states or how they influence perception, memory, and decision-making.
   Limited Self-Reflection: There's no explicit mechanism for self-reflection or meta-cognition, which could enhance lifelike behavior.
   Rigidity in Timing: Systems run at fixed intervals, which may not capture the dynamic and asynchronous nature of real cognition.
   Recommended Enhancements
   Emotion System: Introduce an emotional layer that influences goal prioritization, memory recall, and action selection.
   Meta-Cognition System: Add a reflective layer that periodically reviews the agent's own thoughts, goals, and behaviors.
   Event-Driven Triggers: Allow for interrupt-driven processes where high-priority stimuli can bypass regular intervals.
   Prompting and Structuring Critique
   Strengths
   Contextual Depth: Prompts effectively include past experiences, current stimuli, and long-term goals.
   Structure: The clear separation of perception, thought, and action in the prompts aligns with cognitive realism.
   Weaknesses
   Prompt Overload: The large amount of context in prompts could lead to inefficiencies or loss of focus.
   Limited Creativity: Prompts are very structured, which may stifle emergent behaviors or creative problem-solving.
   Recommended Enhancements
   Incremental Context Updates: Instead of including all context in every prompt, track changes and only update the model with deltas.
   Abstract Summaries: Use a summarization mechanism to condense long histories into abstracted themes (e.g., "You’ve faced repeated failures in diplomacy").
   Creative Freedom: Occasionally introduce open-ended prompts to allow the agent to "dream" or explore novel ideas.
   Proposed New Systems
   Emotion System:

Purpose: Simulate emotional states that influence perception, decision-making, and memory.
Implementation:
Maintain an emotional state vector (e.g., happiness, fear, anger).
Adjust emotions based on stimuli, successes, and failures.
Use emotions to bias perception and goal prioritization.
Meta-Cognition System:

Purpose: Reflect on the agent’s own thoughts and actions to refine behavior.
Implementation:
Periodically review recent actions and thoughts.
Generate self-assessments (e.g., "I’m focusing too much on immediate goals").
Adjust strategies or behaviors based on reflections.
Social Understanding System:

Purpose: Model and predict the intentions, emotions, and goals of other agents.
Implementation:
Track observed behaviors of others.
Use inference to estimate others' internal states.
Adjust the agent’s behavior to align or counteract.
Dreaming System:

Purpose: Allow the agent to explore hypothetical scenarios and generate novel ideas during downtime.
Implementation:
Use low-priority cycles to simulate alternate realities or test plans.
Store valuable insights in long-term memory.
Overall Structuring Recommendations
Hierarchical Structuring:

Use a clear hierarchy: Environment → Perception → Cognition → Action → Reflection.
Event-Driven Execution:

Introduce event-driven triggers for high-priority stimuli or sudden changes.
Asynchronous Processing:

Allow certain systems (e.g., perception, action) to run on-demand rather than fixed intervals.
Final Thoughts
You’re building an exceptionally lifelike cognitive system. The key now is to refine the interplay between systems, introduce emotional and reflective layers, and ensure efficient communication. With these enhancements, your agents will not only act intelligently but also exhibit behaviors that feel deeply human.
